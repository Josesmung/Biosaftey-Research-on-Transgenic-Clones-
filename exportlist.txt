%X As more generic drugs become available in the marketplace, it is a public concern whether the quality, safety, and efficacy of generic drugs are the same as the brand name drug. Under current regulation, the United Stales Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only requires that evidence of bioequivalence in average bioavailability be provided for assessment of bioequivalence. FDA, however does not require that bioequivalence among generic copies of the same brand name drug be demonstrated As a result, it is a concern whether these generic drugs can be used interchangeably. To address this question, the concepts of population bioequivalence for drug prescribability and individual bioequivalence for drug switchability have been proposed. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the draft FDA guidance on "In Vivo Bioequivalence Studies Based on Population and Individual Bioequivalence Approaches" which was distributed for comment in October 1997. The discussion will be primarily on the FDA proposed criteria, design, statistical methods, and interpretations on the assessment of individual bioequivalence from the pharmaceutical industry perspective.

%X Understanding complex natural systems requires approaches with minimal statistical limitations and biases. Previously, however, the fields of behaviour, ecology and evolution generally have been restricted to evaluating differences between statistical distributions. This framework can be very powerful. Unfortunately, it has also created a bias in these, and many other, fields towards publications focusing only on phenomena for which there are statistically significant differences. However, there is a wide range of questions that would benefit from reversing the existing paradigm and testing, instead, for equivalence. We have adapted the two one-sided test (TOST), also known as equivalence testing, from pharmaceutical science to be applicable to behavioural and ecological studies. We created a repeated measures analysis that allows researchers to statistically examine similarities between distributions. We compared song structure in male and female eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis, as a case study for this method. We failed to find significant differences between male and female songs via a more traditional test, repeated measures ANOVA. Therefore, no definitive conclusion could be drawn about the similarities or differences in song structure. However, our repeated measures equivalence test showed that, based on five standard measures of song variation, male and female eastern bluebirds sing statistically equivalent songs. Our study highlights the presence of complex female song in a temperate songbird species. Additionally, we provide a new statistical test useful for expanding the statistical toolbox to assess new behavioural and ecological questions, and to help counteract publication bias in our fields.

%X Bioequivalence of two drug formulations is currently defined by drug regulatory authorities in terms of the mean responses following administration of the test and reference formulations (average bioequivalence). However, the various potential shortcomings of average bioequivalence are now understood, and switchability, and thus individual bioequivalence, has become a reasonable expectation when changing from one pharmaceutically equivalent drug product to another. Progress has been made in developing criteria for individual bioequivalence, and an overview and classification of most of the different approaches to the assessment of individual bioequivalence have been achieved. As a consequence of this classification, the different character of scaled and unscaled bioequivalence measures has been recognized and, in turn, this leads to the proposal, made in this paper, or using both scaled and unscaled criteria for bioequivalence assessment of different classes of drugs, depending on their within-subject variability and therapeutic range. This strategy addresses the shortcomings of average bioequivalence, and, when applied to data sets from bioequivalence studies with four-period replicate crossover designs, turns out to have some satisfactory properties. Open questions and areas for further research are discussed.

%X Increasingly, the goal of many studies is to determine if new therapies have equivalent or noninferior efficacies to the ones currently in use. These studies are called equivalence/noninferiority studies, and the statistical methods for their analysis require only simple modifications to the traditional hypotheses testing framework. Nevertheless, important and subtle issues arise with the application of such methods. This article describes the concepts and statistical methods involved in testing equivalence/noninferiority. The aim is to enable the clinician to understand and critically assess the growing number of articles utilizing such methods.
